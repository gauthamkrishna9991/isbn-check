<h1>A Simple ISBN Application.</h1>

<p>Hello There!<br>I see you brought yourself here to look at this program, and maybe fork/clone it.<br> You're free to do so, But may I say, the algorithms need more polish, more so because I only used an hour to make it. Both ISBN10 and ISBN13 algorithms work as intended, but needs more polish in terms of efficiency.
  The Function IsbnCheck takes in 1 param (string isbn) and returns an integer 1 if its valid, 0 if its invalid, 2 if its of a different length.
  
  Development Platform: WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation), Win32 Application.
  Development Environment: Visual Studio 2017 Update 3
  
Anyway, see you around! If you have any qns, contact me at gauthamkrishna9991@live.com
